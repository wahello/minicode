# HashiCorp Consul Helm Chart

[HashiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/) has multiple components, but as a whole, it is a tool for discovering and configuring services in your infrastructure

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/consul
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [HashiCorp Consul](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-consul) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 2.12+ or Helm 3.0-beta3+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/consul
```

These commands deploy HashiCorp Consul on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```
The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release. Remove also the chart using `--purge` option:

```console
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```

## Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the HashiCorp Consul chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release --set domain=consul-domain,gossipKey=secretkey bitnami/consul
```
The above command sets the HashiCorp Consul domain to `consul-domain` and sets the gossip key to `secretkey`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/consul
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Production configuration

This chart includes a `values-production.yaml` file where you can find some parameters oriented to production configuration in comparison to the regular `values.yaml`. You can use this file instead of the default one.

- Start a side-car prometheus exporter:

```diff
- metrics.enabled: false
+ metrics.enabled: true
```

- Create a Pod disruption budget:

```diff
- pdb.create: false
+ pdb.create: true
```

### Ingress

This chart provides support for ingress resources. If you have an ingress controller installed on your cluster, such as [nginx-ingress](https://kubeapps.com/charts/stable/nginx-ingress) or [traefik](https://kubeapps.com/charts/stable/traefik) you can utilize the ingress controller to service your HashiCorp Consul UI application.

To enable ingress integration, please set `ingress.enabled` to `true`

#### Hosts
Most likely you will only want to have one hostname that maps to this HashiCorp Consul installation, however it is possible to have more than one host.  To facilitate this, the `ingress.hosts` object is an array.

For each item, please indicate a `name`, `tls`, `tlsSecret`, and any `annotations` that you may want the ingress controller to know about.

Indicating TLS will cause HashiCorp Consul to generate HTTPS urls, and HashiCorp Consul will be connected to at port 443.  The actual secret that `tlsSecret` references does not have to be generated by this chart. However, please note that if TLS is enabled, the ingress record will not work until this secret exists.

For annotations, please see [this document](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md). Not all annotations are supported by all ingress controllers, but this document does a good job of indicating which annotation is supported by many popular ingress controllers.

### TLS Secrets
This chart will facilitate the creation of TLS secrets for use with the ingress controller, however this is not required. There are three common use cases:

* helm generates / manages certificate secrets
* user generates / manages certificates separately
* an additional tool (like [kube-lego](https://kubeapps.com/charts/stable/kube-lego)) manages the secrets for the application

In the first two cases, one will need a certificate and a key.  We would expect them to look like this:

* certificate files should look like (and there can be more than one certificate if there is a certificate chain)

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIID6TCCAtGgAwIBAgIJAIaCwivkeB5EMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMFYxCzAJBgNV
...
jScrvkiBO65F46KioCL9h5tDvomdU1aqpI/CBzhvZn1c0ZTf87tGQR8NK7v7
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

* keys should look like:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAvLYcyu8f3skuRyUgeeNpeDvYBCDcgq+LsWap6zbX5f8oLqp4
...
wrj2wDbCDCFmfqnSJ+dKI3vFLlEz44sAV8jX/kd4Y6ZTQhlLbYc=
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

If you are going to use helm to manage the certificates, please copy these values into the `certificate` and `key` values for a given `ingress.secrets` entry.

Please see [this example](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls) for more information.

#### Enable TLS encryption between servers

You must manually create a secret containing your PEM-encoded certificate authority, your PEM-encoded certificate, and your PEM-encoded private key.

> Take into account that you will need to create a config map with the proper configuration.

If the secret is specified, the chart will locate those files at `/opt/bitnami/consul/certs/`, so you will want to use the below snippet to configure HashiCorp Consul TLS encryption in your config map:

```
  "ca_file": "/opt/bitnami/consul/certs/ca.pem",
  "cert_file": "/opt/bitnami/consul/certs/consul.pem",
  "key_file": "/opt/bitnami/consul/certs/consul-key.pem",
  "verify_incoming": true,
  "verify_outgoing": true,
  "verify_server_hostname": true,
```

After creating the secret, you can install the helm chart specyfing the secret name using `tlsEncryptionSecretName=consul-tls-encryption`.

### Metrics

The chart can optionally start a metrics exporter endpoint on port `9107` for [prometheus](https://prometheus.io). The data exposed by the endpoint is intended to be consumed by a prometheus chart deployed within the cluster and as such the endpoint is not exposed outside the cluster.

## Persistence

The [Bitnami HashiCorp Consul](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-consul) image stores the HashiCorp Consul data at the `/bitnami` path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

## Upgrading

### 7.0.0

Consul pods are now deployed in parallel in order to bootstrap the cluster and be discovered.

The field `podManagementPolicy` can't be updated in a StatefulSet, so you need to destroy it before you upgrade the chart to this version.

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset consul
$ helm upgrade <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> bitnami/consul
```

### To 6.0.0

This release updates the Bitnami Consul container to `1.6.1-debian-9-r6`, which is based on Bash instead of Node.js.

### To 3.1.0

Consul container was moved to a non-root approach. There shouldn't be any issue when upgrading since the corresponding `securityContext` is enabled by default. Both the container image and the chart can be upgraded by running the command below:

```
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/consul
```

If you use a previous container image (previous to **1.4.0-r16**) disable the `securityContext` by running the command below:

```
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/consul --set securityContext.enabled=fase,image.tag=XXX
```

### To 2.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 2.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is consul:

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset consul --cascade=false
```
