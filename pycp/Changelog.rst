4.2
---
Pycp now is available on Pypi:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycp/

You can now use --safe to never overwrite files.

4.0.2

Lots of bug fixes, introducing automatic tests

4.0.1
------
Fix bug for Python2.5: threading module still has
only camelCase functions.

4.0
----
Now using ``shutil`` and ``thread`` modules instead of ``subprocess``.
(Replacing ``supbrocess.popen("/bin/cp")`` by calling a thread
running ``shutil.copy``)
Bonus: pycp might become cross-platform

Switch from ``getopt`` to ``OptionParser`` (much better)

3.1

* Now using ``/bin/cp`` instead of ``cp`` (thanks, Chris Gilles)
